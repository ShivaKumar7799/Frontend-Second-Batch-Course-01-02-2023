  <h2>Symptoms</h2>
  <p>When running certain apps on Windows 10 desktop or Windows 10 Mobile, some characters display as a square or rectangular box, or as a box with a dot, question mark or “x” inside, while the same app running on earlier Windows or Windows Phone versions did not have this problem. This issue typically involves text in Middle East or Asian  <br /> </p>  languages (Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, etc.). On Windows 10 Mobile, this issue is most likely to involve East Asian languages (Chinese, Japanese, Korean). On Windows 10 desktop, this issue typically involves text in languages other than the languages for which that system is configured, and within certain types of apps that support scenarios in which international languages may be encountered (e.g., browsing the Web, and user notifications in social networking apps). </p>
